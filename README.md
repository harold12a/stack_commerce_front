# Stack Commerce Project with MERN Stack

## About this project

This repository contains the source code of an e-commerce project developed with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project also uses the React Tailwind CSS and React Icons libraries to improve the user interface.

## Project description

This project is an example of a complete eCommerce application that includes key features such as:

- Product catalog with images and descriptions.
- Shopping cart that allows users to add and remove products.
- Purchase process with order details and shipping form.
- User registration and authentication.
- Administration panel to manage products and orders.

The application uses a MongoDB database to store information about products, users and orders. Express.js takes care of the server logic, while React.js is used to create the interactive and responsive UI. React Tailwind CSS is used to elegantly style the app, and React Icons provides visual icons to enhance the user experience.
